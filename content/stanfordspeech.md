## Beginning

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "00:22.0">}} Thank you.
* {{<t "00:27.5">}} I am honored to be with you today for your commencement
    * commencement = 卒業式
* {{<t "00:30.8">}} from one of the finest universities in the world.  
* {{<t "00:36.5">}} Truth be told, I never graduated from college.  
* {{<t "00:41.7">}} And this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.  
* {{<t "00:48.5">}} Today I want to tell you three stories from my life.  
* {{<t "00:52.0">}} That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.  

## Connecting the dots

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "00:56.4">}} The first story is about connecting the dots.
* {{<t "01:01.4">}} I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months,
* {{<t "01:04.6">}} but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.
    * drop-in = 大学において、正規の学生ではないが聴講する者
* {{<t "01:09.8">}} So why did I drop out?
* {{<t "01:13.0">}} It started before I was born.
* {{<t "01:15.8">}} My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student,
    * unwed = 未婚の
* {{<t "01:20.0">}} and she decided to put me up for adoption.
* {{<t "01:23.0">}} She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates,
* {{<t "01:26.8">}} so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.
* {{<t "01:32.5">}} Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.
    * at the last minute = 直前になって、いよいよという時に、ぎりぎりになってから
* {{<t "01:38.5">}} So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking:
* {{<t "01:44.0">}} "We've got an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?"
* {{<t "01:48.0">}} They said: "Of course."
* {{<t "01:51.5">}} My biological mother found out later
* {{<t "01:53.8">}} that my mother had never graduated from college
* {{<t "01:56.5">}} and that my father had never graduated from high school.
* {{<t "01:59.5">}} She refused to sign the final adoption papers.
* {{<t "02:04.0">}} She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college.
    * relent = 折れる
* {{<t "02:10.0">}} This was the start in my life.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "02:14.5">}} And 17 years later I did go to college.
* {{<t "02:18.0">}} But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford,
* {{<t "02:23.0">}} and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.
    * tuition = 授業料
* {{<t "02:28.2">}} After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.
* {{<t "02:31.3">}} I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life
* {{<t "02:33.9">}} and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.
* {{<t "02:37.3">}} And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.
* {{<t "02:43.1">}} So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.
* {{<t "02:48.0">}} It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "02:54.5">}} The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me,
* {{<t "03:00.2">}} and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.

[Paragraph]
 
* {{<t "03:05.3">}} It wasn't all romantic.
* {{<t "03:07.0">}} I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms,
* {{<t "03:11.0">}} I returned coke bottles for the $0.05 deposits to buy food with,
* {{<t "03:15.0">}} and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night
* {{<t "03:18.8">}} to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple.
* {{<t "03:22.5">}} I loved it.
* {{<t "03:24.0">}} And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition
* {{<t "03:28.3">}} turned out to be priceless later on.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "03:30.5">}} Let me give you one example:
* {{<t "03:33.5">}} Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.
    * calligraphy = 書道
* {{<t "03:38.5">}} Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed.
* {{<t "03:46.0">}} Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes,
* {{<t "03:50.0">}} I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.
* {{<t "03:53.5">}} I learned about serif and san serif typefaces,
* {{<t "03:56.5">}} about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations,
* {{<t "04:00.2">}} about what makes great typography great.
* {{<t "04:03.5">}} It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture,
* {{<t "04:10.0">}} and I found it fascinating.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "04:12.5">}} None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.
* {{<t "04:18.0">}} But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.
* {{<t "04:23.9">}} And we designed it all into the Mac.
* {{<t "04:26.5">}} It was the first computer with beautiful typography.
* {{<t "04:29.8">}} If I had never dropped in on that single course in college,
* {{<t "04:33.5">}} the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.
* {{<t "04:37.8">}} And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "04:50.3">}} If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class,
* {{<t "04:54.6">}} and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.
* {{<t "04:58.7">}} Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college.
* {{<t "05:03.4">}} But it was very, very clear looking backwards 10 years later.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "05:07.5">}} Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward;
* {{<t "05:10.5">}} you can only connect them looking backwards.
* {{<t "05:13.3">}} So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
* {{<t "05:17.0">}} You have to trust in something -- your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
* {{<t "05:22.3">}} Because believing that the dots will connect down the road
* {{<t "05:25.5">}} will give you the confidence to follow your heart
* {{<t "05:28.3">}} even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference.
    * well-worn = 使い古した、着古した、陳腐な、月並みな

## Love and loss

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "05:39.1">}} My second story is about love and loss.
* {{<t "05:44.5">}} I was lucky -- I found what I loved to do early in life.
* {{<t "05:48.8">}} Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20.
* {{<t "05:52.3">}} We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage
* {{<t "05:57.0">}} into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.
* {{<t "06:00.5">}} We had just released our finest creation -- the Macintosh -- a year earlier,
* {{<t "06:04.2">}} and I had just turned 30.
* {{<t "06:06.6">}} And then I got fired.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "06:09.3">}} How can you get fired from a company you started?
* {{<t "06:12.9">}} Well, as Apple grew
* {{<t "06:14.9">}} we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me,
* {{<t "06:18.9">}} and for the first year or so things went well.
* {{<t "06:21.4">}} But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.
* {{<t "06:26.0">}} When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.
* {{<t "06:29.5">}} So at 30 I was out.
* {{<t "06:31.5">}} And very publicly out.
* {{<t "06:33.5">}} What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} I really didn't know what to do for a few months.
* {{<t "">}} I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down --
* {{<t "">}} that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.
* {{<t "">}} I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.
* {{<t "">}} I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley.
* {{<t "">}} But something slowly began to dawn on me -- I still loved what I did.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.
* {{<t "">}} I had been rejected, but I was still in love.
* {{<t "">}} And so I decided to start over.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.
* {{<t "">}} The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.
* {{<t "">}} It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar,
* {{<t "">}} and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.
* {{<t "">}} Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film, Toy Story,
* {{<t "">}} and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.
* {{<t "">}} In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple,
* {{<t "">}} and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.
* {{<t "">}} And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.
* {{<t "">}} It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.
* {{<t "">}} Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick.
* {{<t "">}} Don't lose faith.
* {{<t "">}} I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.
* {{<t "">}} You've got to find what you love.
* {{<t "">}} And that is as true for work as it is for your lovers.
* {{<t "">}} Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,
* {{<t "">}} and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.
* {{<t "">}} And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
* {{<t "">}} If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.
* {{<t "">}} And don't settle.
* {{<t "">}} As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
* {{<t "">}} And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.
* {{<t "">}} So keep looking.
* {{<t "">}} Don't settle.
 
## Death

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} My third story is about death.
* {{<t "">}} When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like:
* {{<t "">}} "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."
* {{<t "">}} It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years,
* {{<t "">}} I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself:
* {{<t "">}} "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"
* {{<t "">}} And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered
* {{<t "">}} to help me make the big choices in life.
* {{<t "">}} Because almost everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure --
* {{<t "">}} these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
* {{<t "">}} Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
* {{<t "">}} You are already naked.
* {{<t "">}} There is no reason not to follow your heart.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.
* {{<t "">}} I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.
* {{<t "">}} I didn't even know what a pancreas was.
* {{<t "">}} The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable,
* {{<t "">}} and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order,
* {{<t "">}} which is doctor's code for prepare to die.
* {{<t "">}} It means to try and tell your kids everything
* {{<t "">}} you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.
* {{<t "">}} It means to make sure everything is buttoned up
* {{<t "">}} so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.
* {{<t "">}} It means to say your goodbyes.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} I lived with that diagnosis all day.
* {{<t "">}} Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat,
* {{<t "">}} through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.
* {{<t "">}} I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that
* {{<t "">}} when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying 
* {{<t "">}} because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.
* {{<t "">}} I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} This was the closest I've been to facing death,
* {{<t "">}} and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades.
* {{<t "">}} Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than
* {{<t "">}} when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:
* {{<t "">}} No one wants to die.
* {{<t "">}} Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.
* {{<t "">}} And yet death is the destination we all share.
* {{<t "">}} No one has ever escaped it.
* {{<t "">}} And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.
* {{<t "">}} It is Life's change agent.
* {{<t "">}} It clears out the old to make way for the new.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now,
* {{<t "">}} you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.
* {{<t "">}} Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
* {{<t "">}} Don't be trapped by dogma -- which is living with the results of other people's thinking.
* {{<t "">}} Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.
* {{<t "">}} And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
* {{<t "">}} They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
* {{<t "">}} Everything else is secondary.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog,
* {{<t "">}} which was one of the bibles of my generation.
* {{<t "">}} It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park,
* {{<t "">}} and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.
* {{<t "">}} This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing,
* {{<t "">}} so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.
* {{<t "">}} It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along:
* {{<t "">}} it was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog,
* {{<t "">}} and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.
* {{<t "">}} It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.
* {{<t "">}} On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road,
* {{<t "">}} the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.
* {{<t "">}} Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." 
* {{<t "">}} t was their farewell message as they signed off.
* {{<t "">}} Stay Hungry.
* {{<t "">}} Stay Foolish.

[Paragraph]

* {{<t "">}} And I have always wished that for myself.
* {{<t "">}} And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.
* {{<t "">}} Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
* {{<t "">}} Thank you all very much.
