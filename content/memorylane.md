Live amongst no roses, only the drama  
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja  
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces  
You're telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces  
Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow  
And back down po-po when I'm vexed so  
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank  
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank  
Pumpin' for somethin', some'll prosper, some fail  
Judges hanging niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales  
My intellect prevails from a hanging cross with nails  
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real  
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats  
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say "Peace."  
I hung around the older crews  
While they sling smack to dingbats  
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black  
Some fiends scream, about Supreme Team  
A Jamaica Queens thing  
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin  
Yo, fuck "rap is real", watch the herbs stand still  
Never talking to snakes, ‘cause the words of man kill  
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins  
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane  
  
[Hook]  
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"  
"Coming outta Queensbridge"  
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"  
"Coming outta Queensbridge"  
  
[Outro: DJ Premier scracthing]  
"Coming out of Queensbridge" (X4)  
"The most dangerous MC is…"  
"Coming out of Queensbridge"  
"The most dangerous MC is…"  
"Coming out of Queensbridge"  
"The most dangerous MC is…"  
"Coming out of Queensbridge"  
"The most dangerous MC is…"  
"You're number one and y'know where you're from"
