[4: Phesto]  
Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in  
Close range, I throws game at your dip like handball  
'Cause the man's all that  
All phat, I be the chill from 93 'til  
  
[Hook]  
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill from 93 'til  
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill, from 93 'til  
This is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill.. from 93 'til  
  
[5: A-Plus]  
Huh, my black Timbs do me well (yeah)  
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (what?)  
Another person's business, I cause dizziness  
Until you - stop acting like a silly bitch  
  
[6: Phesto]  
Yo, crews are jealous 'cause we get props  
The cops, wanna stop - our fun, but the top  
Is where we're dwellin, swell and fat, no sleep  
I work fit and jerks get their hoes sweeped  
Under their noses, this bro's quick  
They hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin 'cause my crew's close, kid  
  
[7: Tajai]  
I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool  
I exit, cause I'm an exception to the rule  
I'm steppin - to the cool spots where crews flock to snare a dip  
Or see where the shit that's flam B  
Blam leakin out his pocket  
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement, my ace been  
Fattenin up tracks, Time to get prolific with the whiz kid  
  
[8: Opio]  
Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask  
Who got the fat sacks? We can max pumpin' fat tracks  
Exchangin facts about impacts, 'cause in facts  
My freestyle talent overpowers brothers can't hack.. it  
They lack wit; we got the mack shit  
93 'Til Infinity - kill all that wack shit  
  
[Hook]  
This is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill from 93 'til  
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill, from 93 'til  
This is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill.. from 93 'til  
  
[9: Phesto]  
I be coolin; school's in session but I'm fresh in  
Rappin so I take time off to never rhyme soft  
I'm off on my own shit with my own clique  
Roll many back roads with a fat stog' and blunt, folding runts  
Holding stunts captive with my persona  
Plus a bomber, zestin  
Niggas is testin my patience; but I stay fresh and  
  
[10: Tajai]  
Restin at the mall, attendance on 'noid  
But I am shoppin for my wish to exploit  
Some cute fits, some new kicks  
I often do this cause it's the pits not bein dipped  
  
[11: Opio]  
Flip the flyer attire females desire  
Baby you can step to this if you admire  
The ex..traordinary dapper rapper  
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her  
  
[12: A-Plus]  
I'll mack her; attack her with the smoothness  
I do this, peepin what my crew gets (huh)  
Loot, props, respect and blunts to pass  
Crews talk shit, but in my face they kiss my ass (smak!)  
They bite flows but we make up new ones  
If you're really dope, why ain't ya signed yet?  
But I get - my loot from Jive/Zomba, I'mma bomb ya  
You will see - from now 'til infinity  
  
[Hook]  
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill from 93 'til  
Yeah this is how we chill from 93 'til  
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill, from 93 'til  
Yeah this is how we chill from 93 'til  
This is how we chill.. from 93 'til  
  
[Outro]  
Hah-hah, just coolin out, y'know what I'm sayin  
But, but who's chillin around the land y'know?  
Yo, who's chillin? I think I know who's chillin  
Yeah tell me who's chillin then then Plus  
  
Casual - you know he's chillin  
Yo, Pep Love- he gotta be chillin  
Jay-Biz- ya know he's chillin  
Aiyyo man, my my man Snupe is chillin man  
Yo Mike G - you know he's here chillin
