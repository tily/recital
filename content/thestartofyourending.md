* I'm open off the Dainy  
Obey me or get sprayed with the sweeper  
Cause I'm my brothers keeper  
The Grim Reaper holdin' with nothin' but big batters  
And big heaters  
Blow ya three times leave a mark like Adidas  
Jig you I know how to fix you  
Pretty boy niggas frontin' hard is the issue  
Word to my unborn you get scolded  
Old and molded when I get bent you get folded  
Every rhyme is the truth that I must get cross  
Put your right on your back take it to the source  
No doubt I'm stuck and I can't get out  
Of this lifestyle the 41st side get bent run wild  
The 41st side two  
You know how we do, violate motherfucker  
I'ma see you, with the Linden  
It's the start of your endin' settin' it again and again  
  
[Talking]  
Yeah kid, big time boy. 12th street representin' it. A big shout out to my  
Man. Tear Gas, Think, Nate whole crew kid  
You knowhatI'msayin'? I'm sayin' couso. Richie Fraud known to leave ya  
Scarred. Big shoot out to my man Heavy L. Big Palms representing  
  
[Verse 2: Prodigy]  
Yo, it's the P. E. double push a Lex bubble in the winter  
You can't come along only the hoes can enter  
Told her to meet me at six on the hill at the center  
Took her to the west way and bent her right over  
Stay intoxicated, never sober  
Faced it, violate and get lace'd  
Why you wasting slugs? You ain't buckin' nothing  
You better off buckin' yourself you need to stop fronting  
I used to drive an Ac and kept a Mac in the engine  
Littles painted it black with crack sale intentions  
To blow up the whole projects the Infamous  
Our sons will grow up to be murderers and terrorists  
It's the nigga in me, accompanied by the cognac  
You can ask around, don't fuck with the Mobb  
I could've told you that, where you been at  
You must have cut class  
If it ain't me, another member of my crew will kick your ass (what what)  
We do damage to limbs  
In '91, stomping you out with black Timbs  
Prodigy and the H.A.V.O.C. from the Q.B.C  
Putting cowards where they're supposed to be  
If I don't know your face then don't come close to me  
I got too much beef for that  
Drama in the 3rd degree  
And to the kids you don't wanna be me  
I'm up in the mix of action, where niggas wanna kill me  
But it's the start of they ending my man's lending  
Me his Lenden forty-two shots depending  
On whether or not the clip is full to the top  
We busting caps non-stop Blazing  
In all the shows and even at the hoes  
(nah, nah chill son)  
What?  
  
[Outro]  
  
And it's the start of your ending  
Yeah, yeah it's the start of niggas ending, youknowhatI'msayin?  
And it's the start of your ending  
All y'all weak-ass crews that got drama with mines, youknowhatI'msayin'  
It's the start of your ending  
And it's the motherfuckin' start of the ending  
You know who you fuckin' with  
(Yeah, yeah nigga) you know what will happen  
(Recognize and realize)  
41st side get bent, run wild  
41st side get bent, run wild  
Word up youknowhatI'msayin'?
